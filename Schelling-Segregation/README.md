# Schelling's models of residential segregation

This folder contains two versions of Thomas Schelling's seminal models of residential segregation: a one-dimensional version and a two-dimensional version. The first is the model as presented in [Schelling's (1969)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1823701) article in the American Economic Review; the second as presented in the 1978 book "[Micromotives and Macrobehavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling#Micromotives_and_Macrobehavior_(1978))".  

While the models library that comes with Netlogo also contains an implementation of the model by default, the implementations included here follow the original assumptions of the model somewhat more closely, which in some cases has implications for the results. The models furthermore include several extensions that are useful to explore the behavior of the model, including a choice of settings for actors' preferences, and a visualization of actors' "happiness". 

See the README files in the separate folders for more information on each model.
